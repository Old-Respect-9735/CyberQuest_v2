# **What is *Networking*?**
On a basic level, networking is the practice of connecting devices to allow them to access information and data. Some key concepts in networking involve protocols and services, security, and IP Addresses. 

## **Why is learning about networking important?**
In the modern day, with the increasing reliance on digital communication, cybersecurity and knowledge about networking concepts have never been more important. In this chapter, you will understand the fundamentals of networking. These lessons will empower you to protect your data as you will understand packets; the basics of Internet Protocol; routers, switches, and hubs; the basics of command lines; and some basic networking attacks. 

### **What are packets?**
Packets are the fundamental pieces of data in networking. They are smaller pieces of information that are part of a larger data stream. On a basic level, all packets contain headers and payloads that allow them to get routed around a network efficiently. The header of a packet contains information like source and destination IP addresses. The payload contains the actual information that needs to be sent. Packets are reassembled at their destination points and the data is extracted.
