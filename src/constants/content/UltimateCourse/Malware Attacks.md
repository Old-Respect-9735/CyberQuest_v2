Making Connections: Malware often threatens the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of data (the CIA Triad). 

## **Why is it important to learn about common malware attacks?**
This chapter focuses on the common malware attacks used by cybercriminals. By learning about the different techniques and symptoms of malware attacks, you will be better equipped to handle and protect your data, devices, and networks.

## **What are some indicators of a malware attack?**
There are a few generic indicators of a malware attack: extra traffic, encrypted data exfiltration, traffic to specific IP Addresses, and outgoing spam emails. 

Malware typically causes extra traffic to flow through a network. 

Oftentimes, malware attempts to take data out of a network and place it in the hands of attackers.

### **What are Bots/Botnets?**
A botnet is a group of multiple computers that act as bots that function together in a network. Frequently, botnets are used for malicious activities. 

Bots in a botnet are often called zombies. Zombies will execute the bidding of whoever controls the botnet. 

Bot herders are the criminals who manage botnets. 

### **What are Trojans?**
Trojans are a type of malware that comes disguised as something beneficial to a computer. For example, a trojan could be a useful utility that entices users to download it. 

Scareware is a type of malware that is a subset of trojans. Scareware is malware that is combined with social engineering for maximum efficiency. 

For example, scareware can advertise itself as a free antivirus program. More specifically, whenever a user visits a shady website with scareware, a pop-up that warns about “viruses detected on your machine” could appear. The user is then tempted to download the scareware as they fear for the security of their machine. 

### **What are keyloggers?**
Keyloggers are malware attacks that monitor and record a user’s keystrokes. While keyloggers are usually software-based, hardware, such as a USB keylogger, is also an option. Recorded keystrokes are typically stored in a file that is then sent to the attacker. 

Keyloggers can be effectively thwarted with two-factor authentication. 

### **What are some ways to prevent keylogging?**
Now that we understand the dangers of keylogging, let’s learn about the best ways to prevent damage from keylogging. Two-factor authentication is one of the best ways to negate the symptoms of keylogging.
